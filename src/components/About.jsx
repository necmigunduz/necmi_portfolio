        Hello and Welcome!
      </h1>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        I’m <span className="font-semibold">Necmi</span>, bringing over <span className="font-semibold">15 years</span> of experience as an economist and <span className="font-semibold">5 years</span> as a software developer. I’m passionate about teaching and mentoring students at all levels—from high school to university.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        In <span className="font-semibold">Economics</span>, I guide students through AP Economics, Macroeconomics, Microeconomics, and Statistics, helping them understand not just the theory, but how it applies in the real world. For aspiring developers, I mentor in <span className="font-semibold">JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Data Science</span>, focusing on practical skills that prepare you for real projects and careers.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        My goal is simple: to make learning engaging, connect theory with practice, and help each student build confidence and mastery in both Economics and Software Development. Whether you’re exploring your first concepts or aiming to deepen your expertise, I’m here to support your journey. <strong>Let’s learn, grow, and achieve your goals together!</strong>
